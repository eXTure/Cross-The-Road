# Cross-The-Road
Cross The Road is a mini game I created with the help of a tutorial and now I continue to improve it.

Improvements made:
  Unit collision detection for aditional enemies
  Player name input
  Scoring system
    Current score displayed when "Space" key is pressed

In progress: display highest scores in game when a "Tab" key is pressed
